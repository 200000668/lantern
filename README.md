# lanterna

FEUP - LEIC
LDTS project

THis project is developed in java, using lanterna to create a graphic user interface.

In this game we are going to use lanterna to create a text-based graphical environment to create an adventure, where the player has to navigate 
through a black pitch maze, finding a way out.
The main mechanic we will be trying to implement is a pack of differente labyrinths, populated by generic enemies, and the player has to avoid them,
while discovering the path that will lead him to the exit. As the player uncovers unexplored areas, with the help of lighting equipment (a lantern)
those areas will become familiar to the player being possible to backtrack to areas already explored without the uncertainty of the unknown.

For a more ambicious project we intend to implemente the following features:
- procedurally generated mazes;
- multiple enemy types;
- power-ups found through the mazes (differente types of lighting devices like lanterns, lighters...);
- possibility of eliminating enemies with the power of light;
- real time play (enemies have paths and movement independent of player movement);
- timed playththroughs, that when overpasted summons spirits that haunts the player down;
- export the scores/times of each playthrough to files to keep an hi-score and other important information.

All this will be developed with the help of tests and the MVC programming method.
